## COCKTAILDB API
 #### This website utilizes the thecocktaildb API to allow users to search for the ingredient list and build process for almost any cocktail you can think of. 
 #### If the user cannot even begin to decide on a cocktail that they want. The website also has a feature for a "I'm feeling lucky" option where the user can click the button which returns a random cocktail.
